//Inheriting from AnyObject allows comparison for reference equality (===)
//When deciding what type of collection to use as a list of Observers in the Observable
//protocol, I needed to decide between Array and Set.
//A set would be ideal, but then I would need to implement the Hashable protocol on Observers.
//Checking for reference equality is useful in the removeObserver method in Observable.
